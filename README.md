In this repository, I’ve built a simple interactive game using Haskell and the Gloss library to handle the graphics. The goal was to create a fun, easy-to-understand example of how to implement game mechanics and visuals in a functional programming language.

# What the Game Does:
The game lets users interact through input prompts, and based on their choices, the game’s state changes and progresses. I used Gloss to handle the graphical side, making sure the visuals are smooth and easy to follow.

# Key Features:
Haskell for Game Logic: I’ve written the game logic using Haskell’s functional programming features like immutability and recursion, which helps keep the code clean and easy to manage.
Interactive Gameplay: Players make choices, and the game responds to their input, updating the game state as they go.
Graphics with Gloss: To make the game visually appealing, I used Gloss to handle rendering, providing smooth 2D graphics.
Simple and Accessible: The design is straightforward, making it a great starting point for anyone new to Haskell or interested in using Gloss for building interactive applications.
This project is a great way to get familiar with Haskell and Gloss while having fun with a simple game.
